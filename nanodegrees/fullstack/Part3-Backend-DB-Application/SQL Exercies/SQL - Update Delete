Updating Away The Span

where content = 'The whole spam post';
or
where content like '%awful%';

update table set column = value where restriction ;

The restriction works the same as in select and supports the same set of operators on column values.

The like operator supports a simple form of text pattern-matching. Whatever is on the left side of the operator (usually the name of a text column) will be matched against the pattern on the right. The pattern is an SQL text string (so it's in 'single quotes') and can use the % sign to match any sub-string, including the empty string.

If you are familiar with regular expressions, think of the % in like patterns as being like the regex .* (dot star).

If you are more familiar with filename patterns in the Unix shell or Windows command prompt, % here is a lot like * (star) in those systems.

For instance, for a table row where the column fish has the value 'salmon', all of these restrictions would be true:

fish like 'salmon'
fish like 'salmon%'
fish like 'sal%'
fish like '%n'
fish like 's%n'
fish like '%al%'
fish like '%'
fish like '%%%'
And all of these would be false:

fish like 'carp'
fish like 'salmonella'
fish like '%b%'
fish like 'b%'
fish like ''
